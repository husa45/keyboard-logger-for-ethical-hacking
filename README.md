<br/>
**This is a keylogger that is used to log all key strokes on the target , plus capturing everything  copied to the clipboard .**<br/>

### Installation : 
First : clone the repository to the intended destination<br/>
```
git clone https://github.com/husa45/keyboard-logger-for-ethical-hacking 
```
<br/>
Then download the dependencies by typing :
<br/>

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Linux support :
Now , if you are in a linux machine ,then this key logger supports key logging and clipboard capture , with the ability to clean the clipboard every time it is captured , to avoid recapturing previuosly captured stuff. <br/>


If you want to use the script in  an editor , make sure to press 'esc'
when you finish , as this is the way to break out of the key logger thread.

This tool will automatically log the results to a file in the current working directory ,unless specified elsewhere .

Also , after the script is finished , the log will be sent automatically to your email (**From the log file path that you specified in the keylogging scipt**)

For this tool to function as  it is intended , it should be used as an infinit running cronjob , 
or preferably as a daemon(Systemd unit).

To do that ,first , create a unit by typing the following :
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/key_logger.service
```
Then copy the contents of keylogger.service provided in the repository files to the newly created systemd file 

‚ÄºÔ∏è **Important note** : you should change the DISPLAY environment variable , to whatever your current DISPLAY environment variable is ,
type : ```echo $DISPLAY```
then change the **Environment=DISPLAY=:1** line to whatever value you got.

**If the environment variable DISPLAY isnt set correctly , pynput wont be able to connect to the display manager and the script wont run**.<br/><br/>

**you should also change the variable ExecStart as guided inside the file ( here you specify the path of python interpreter + the path of the tool script).**<br/>


finally ,type the following :
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start keylogger.service
```
Check if the unit is running :
```
systemctl status keylogger.service
```

**And now the tool is running in the background ,and captures everything typed by the keyboard or copied to the clipboard ,and then sent to the email that you want**

‚ùï**Note :** the systemd daemon file was written so that whenever the script finsihes (by typing esc or any other forcing reason) , it will be restarted automatically . 

üëÄ **Future updates :adding support for windows**.
